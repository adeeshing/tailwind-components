# Tailwind Components

> A collection of well-crafted components built using TailwindCSS for your next project

### Introduction

[**Tailwind CSS**](https://tailwindcss.com) is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

We created a collection of commonly used components on a website but instead of using CSS Frameworks or from scratch, we are using TailwindCSS and make it easier to create a fully customized website.
